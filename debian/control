Description: Live-update runtime for Toit programs on ESP32 devices
 A runtime service for ESP32 microcontrollers that enables
 wireless deployment of Toit applications. Jaguar provides an HTTP-based
 mechanism for pushing new versions of programs directly to the device,
 eliminating the need for re-flashing firmware via serial.
